Morgia The author has endless gratitude for those that played a part in the subsequently mentioned periods of his life. He has, therefore, mentioned them by name in honor of the roles they played for himself and the pivotal moments during World War II. They are also mentioned for historical reference. Additional information on these individuals may at some point be hyperlinked to electronic versions of this publication to widen their historical reference. Those who are mentioned, or those in their immediate family may have the right to withhold information. In life, an individual is confronted by challenges that may or may not have been caused by that individual\u2019s own actions but must be dealt with pragmatically. Because I believe each individual has the power within to shape the outcome, how that individual deals with the situation greatly influences the outcome. The individual, in this regard, is at the center of the universe and should accept each challenge with the hope to achieve a favorable outcome. I am both a scholar of science and a believer in God the almighty; maker of heaven and earth. This story is about the experiences in my life and focuses on my ultimate test; the challenge presented to me at a time when I did not expect it or believe I could have been ready for it. My faith in God and country inspired me to persevere in a desperate situation. Counter to some popular belief, the U.S. Army is an organized, efficient, and effective force intensely loyal to its underlings. I must say I always admired it and in some ways look upon my service in World War II as some of the most exhilarating times in my life. the U.S. Army is composed of a complex hierarchy structure from the Division at the top of the hierarchy all the way down to the squad units. Each Division is comprised of three regiments and each regiment is comprised of three Battalions. Each Battalion has four Company\u2019s of which one was under my command. Each Company consists of four platoons. And lastly, each platoon is comprised of three squads. The regiment is the most important unit in the army.

The regiment is the most important unit in the army. The reason being is that it is essentially a do-it-yourself organization. The regiment becomes a \u201ctask force\u201d when the Division commander\u2019s assign artillery, engineers, and other support units to be controlled by the regimental commander. The leader has direct control of all the units to execute a complex mission. Importantly, the command does not need to order outside help which, most of the time, is not ready to mesh with the mission. So, it was the \u201ctask force Church\u201d (named after Brigadier General John Church) or the rCt (regimental combat team) which operated under Church. These commanders were unlike the high command in that they conducted flexible operations meaning they had power to move men and machinery in a short notice of time. The commanders had an \u201cobjective\u201d with many moving parts. Different battles throughout history could be said to be similar, but no two are the same. An analogy is that the objective is to make a touchdown and as the team moves down field, the plays are adjusted accordingly to realize the objective. The commander is more quarterback than symphony conductor. Therefore, warfare is controlled chaos; unpredictable at best with no real order or rhythm. Soldiers had to step into the moment and survive with what was in front of them and use what was available to them requiring high degrees or resourcefulness. I guess that is why I had such an affinity for the army as I grew-up in the Depression and was required to be resourceful to survive and prosper.

My hope is that the events in this book, that occurred over 70 years ago, give the reader a sense of what war is but in a different time and the struggles that drives one to persevere in times of little hope and despair. Make no mistake, it was a time of wide-spread pessimism in the world and we were at the doorstep of the Axis powers \u2013 just meters away from Germany and facing a desperate, focused enemy hell bent on defending their homeland. It was a time that would later be termed \u201cthe Battle of the Bulge\u201d; a major turning-point in World War II where the allies ultimately defeated the Axis powers. With the stroke of grace for those that made it home and with levels of connection that I would feel remiss if left out. Like most soldiers of World War II, when it came to an end on those decisive days such as Ve Day and VJ Day, we went back to our hometowns in America as I did to pick-up where we left off. As I had to leave the University of Connecticut for Europe before graduating and upon my return home, I finished my studies to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry. After that having sufficient credit to continue my schooling, the army compensated us to continue our education for free. I earned a master\u2019s Degree in Chemistry at New York University in manhattan in June 1949. I then proceeded to work at my first job, fall in love with my wife, settle in the suburbs, and made a good living as a chemical engineer raising five children. Every year the 84th Railsplitter Society ran a convention in cities around the U.S.. My wife and I would attend these conventions around the country where it was convenient (accessible by car) for us to travel to. These conventions were the only place the war was ever discussed. The comraderie never faded with my brother\u2019s-in-arms. But as the years went by, the numbers of those brothers began to diminish.

Health issues beset by after-war lifestyles took their toll on many of my war buddies as the war had never had. Growing up, my children never heard a word from me about any part of the war discussed in this book. In fact, in 1974, I gave away all my Nazi memorabilia to a local war collector for free. I had items consisting of knives, pistols, flags, etc taken from dead Nazi\u2019s. The Army allowed us to take whatever we wanted and bring home in our footlockers. At the time we just thought of them as souvenirs; items taken from our dead foes to symbolize our victory. Not until when I was in retirement and had time on my hands to dwell on the war years did my children ever know details of my time in battle. Also with the aging of the greatest generation, historians and lovers of battle tales and logistics were thirsty to hear first-hand accounts from soldiers before their voices were silenced. Oral histories were begun to be recorded. Mine is in the national archives. Even a WWII memorial was finally built in Washington, DC in 2004 in recognition that our numbers were dwindling at approximately 1,000 old soldiers each day. I being a WWII veteran still in good health and sound mind began to be contacted through the wonders of the internet. A man named reg Jans contacted me and we began an enduring friendship. He told me how he was making a living giving tours of the very grounds where we fought our historical battles in early 1945 to retake Beho. Reg, in turn, gave my name to others who were making documentaries and writing their own books about WWII. I provided valuable, first-hand accounts to provide authenticity to their books.

It turns out with no commanding office to give me orders or a high-ranking general micro-managing me, as Company Commander, I initiated an attack plan effective and flexible enough to meet any plausible situation and exact a positive outcome for the allied forces. After receiving the Silver Star for bravery in action, it prompted the Command to replicate my strategy of speed and stealth which was instrumental in bringing the war to a quicker close and, hence, saving both allied and German lives. Before I decided on my own to initiate my offense on the Germans at 5 am, all battles started at 9 am after breakfast. I do not know who created this battle strategy but I knew that good men were dying on both sides and a strategy that addressed minimizing exposure time was the best strategy. I must thank my father, Umberto, who never talked much but led by example. He would never let me forget that \u201cthe early bird gets the worm\u201d. This philosophy no doubt was ingrained in him as he lived on a farm in Italy until coming to the U.S. In 1915 and continued to rise with the chickens each day in Bridgeport, Connecticut. After Beho, I noticed a shift in the general\u2019s thinking; they started to use the element of surprise. The generals became more strategic in their maneuvers. They planned more and if the plan went awry, they did not hesitate to postpone or scrub the mission. I\u2019d like to believe after Beho, I was given safer assignments as rewards for giving them a great tool for at least throwing the enemy off the element of surprise. Changing things-up, never letting the enemy see all your cards, proved effective. They entrusted me with the responsibility of PX duty. I handled all the provisions.

Morgia.\n\nCHAPTER 1 LT. W. W. THOMPSON\u2019S THREE DAY PASS TO Paris\nWorld War II saw many sacrifices for both soldiers in direct combat and civilians caught in collateral damage. Across many cultures and countries, the war became a great unifier of peoples whose mission in life was to support the war effort. In my family, my brother and I were enlisted in the army. My mother worked in the brass shop converted over to make flashlights for soldiers. My father operated a magnetic crane to allow metal to be recycled and converted into war machines. We recycled just about everything. This was the sacrifice for a world faced with an aggression that presented a threat to political and economic stability. Thinking back, no one really understood the implications of what we faced as a country. Coming off a long and stubborn Depression, people were happy just to have a job. Beyond the uncertainty, we pushed forward leading the world through darkness to the glimmer it holds today. I had always done well in school and knew that I wanted to be an engineer of some type.

I was accepted to the University of Connecticut at the storrs campus. When I joined the rotC program on campus, the United states was not at war although Europe was engaged in battles with Nazi germany. The U.s. Had a generally isolationist policy and still remembered World War I; we were just trying to stay out of the fray. What abruptly ended this policy, of course, was the bombing of pearl Harbor by the Japanese in December 1941. That act of war unleashed one of the greatest war machines in the history of the world. Our entire country immediately went into \u201cWar\u201d mode the likes of which had to even surprise those who would become our allies. Food was rationed, women gave up their nylons and just painted fake seams onto the back of their legs to give the appearance of nylons, war bonds were sold by actors before movies, women replaced men going off to war in factories and sports teams just to keep everything running at home while young men ran off to war in droves. There was no question as to whether it was the politically correct thing to do but the only thing to do. No men from \u201cThe Greatest Generation\u201d ran off to Canada opposing the war. The United states may have been reluctant to get into World War II and for good reason but once we got in, we were in it to win it. As ROTC, I was whisked off to officer-candidate school at Camp Legeune in georgia for 4 weeks of basic training. It was here that I met up with the man who would be my commanding officer and friend for life, Lt. William W. \u201ctommy\u201d thompson.

He and I were raised complete polar-opposites but we formed a fast and enduring friendship and brotherhood that spanned five decades until his death in 2003.

Thompson, company commander for E Company 334th infantry regiment, 84th Division was not ordered to take a three day Paris pass. Lt. Thompson deserved that threeday pass. He earned it by saving his entire platoon from a possible ambush and certain death by the nazis while traversing the ardennes forest. There my 72 hour long gauntlet began. Navigating a group of young men across enemy lines and countless unsettling adversities, under the leadership of their new commander, an inexperienced new lieutenant with an rotC background to rise-up in the ranks overnight. My first day in command was January 17, 1945. It was E Company\u2019s first rear area rest since fighting an offensive action to push the German troops out of the Ciele, Belgium area (see map). We took many casualties and desperately needed rest and regrouping to fight as a full-strength Company. The town of Barvaux, Belgium (see map) became our momentary sanctuary of much needed rest. The town became our rest on January 17, 1945. We both started with E Company, 334 infantry, 84th infantry Division on november 17, 1944 by attacking the siegfried line in the geilenkirken area, near Holland. On the first day of the attack, E Co. Lost most of its leaders and Lt. Thompson became the new company commander and I became the executive officer. We spent the whole month overcoming German troops and destroying pillboxes. The distance covered during this time was about 2 miles. The Germans were very well organized and gave up very little ground.

The only relaxation that company E had was spending several days in the basement of a school building in geilenkirken to get cleaned up. I remembered that we did that several times. On December 17, 1944, in the vicinity of the Roer river, we were mounted on trucks and ended up in marche, Belgium. To block the German troops advance into Belgium. This later became known as the Battle of the Bulge. For over two weeks, the E Company troops held the attacking Germans back on a front from marche to Hotton with other elements of the 84th Division. The next two weeks the 84th Division and other allied troops pushed the Germans back to where they started a month earlier. Someone had a camera and took several pictures of myself and Lt. Thompson and battlefield commission Lt. Clyde Laurent. Attached are those pictures. It did not take long after Lt. Thompson left for Paris that I was ordered to meet with the newly assigned Battalion Commander, Lt. Col Leonard Umanoff, for the 2nd Battalion of the 334th Infantry. Lt. Col Umanoff replaced former Battalion Commander, Lt. Col. Williams but had very little experience as an infantry leader in theater. This newly assigned battalion commander had little experience on the battlefield with the 84th Infantry Division. He was a replacement directly from the West Point Teaching Staff. He would be used \u201con and off\u201d to replace former E Company Commanders who were injured in battle.

Late in the afternoon of January 21, it was necessary for the battalion Company officers to go on reconnaissance to an area of woods near the town of Halconreax. This reconnaissance was necessary and is typical so that as troops are brought in, the lay of the land is known and would go towards minimizing casualties. The pine trees were heavily loaded with snow and it was very quiet and cold with a bright sun that didn\u2019t make it past the snow-covered obstacles to warm us below.

The Germans had taken approximately 60,000 american lives in only one month! I was now leading my Company into some of the most aggressive fighting in the war. Newly appointed Lt. Col. Umanoff joined my company in the town of Halconreaux and we both lead E Company eastward through the snow towards Beho.

Tactically, my assessment of the situation was that we should not expose ourselves which would put both e and F Company\u2019s at an unacceptable risk. In hind sight this was the right decision as the German troops occupied the high ground in the gouvy area and had a superior advantage. Since E Company was, in fact, very close to German positions on its right flank, intervention would have possibly ended its mission to maneuver elsewhere. Life lesson: pick your battles. F Company ultimately waited until nightfall to move to their objective; Beho. F Company stayed in their position in the Beho area in reserve status. The Battalion commander made the decision to keep them inactive on the chance they would be needed if the battle of Beho became overwhelming.

I knew this was a sound strategy by studying the map we were provided by the engineers of the topographical map of the area. I learned map reading during my time at the ROTC. Lt. Umanoff agreed with my rationale. Getting to Halconreaux took more time but was the lower-risk alternative. Ultimately, we all got safely to the woods without the Germans spotting us. Although some U.S. Artillery fire dropped nearby during our maneuvering, we suffered no casualties. This was the beginning of a series of decisive moves \u2013 a game of subtle balance wherein the smallest differences in strategy could have devastating consequences and left no room for error. A mathematical conundrum where game theory met practical application. Once in the woods, around 1400 hours (2 pm), it was agreed that we would follow the railroad tracks through the wood\u2019s eastern edge which was close to Beho, our prime objective. Of course, how to find the snow-covered railroad leading to Beho was our prime concern. We deployed two scout parties comprised of three soldiers each that took two separate paths heading north. The scout report later returned that indeed the railroad tracks were, in fact, as shown on the Army-issued map. Lt. Col. Umanoff ordered me to lead E Company on the tracks to our objective. The original regimental plan was that E Company would participate in attacking Beho with other units of the 334th regiment at 1700 hours (5 pm).

Raymond, Battalion G-4 Supply Officer that the deep freeze helped E Company get through without detonating mines as the ground was frozen. The cold obviously did have an advantage. It saved our lives. Since E Company arrived in Beho late, there were no available spots in or near town to settle in for the night. The men of E Company had only blankets and white camouflage outer cover sheets to spend the night in the snow covered field outside Beho. No one really slept much as the fear was if you slept, you may not wake-up succumbing to the cold. An interesting letter was sent to me many years after the War from Lt. Raymond in which he shared that the horse and buggy he had borrowed which carried all the blankets were destroyed by mines on the n-69 road near Beho. He used such primitive local equipment to deliver wool blankets to the g.i.\u2019s on the front line. The horse and buggy were heavy enough to detonate the mines. In general, mechanized vehicles were not effective during the American Offensive in this theater. The roads were icy and slick, the temperatures too low, and the forests too thick.

F Company was to remain in reserve status. G Company, under Capt. Hyatt, was to take a wooded area just south of the E Company objective. F Company was to remain in reserve status and remained in town. I struggled to stay awake during the meeting and the Lt. Col made sure that I understood the assignment. I realized that I must assemble the E Company men as quickly as possible. I directed the platoon leaders, 2nd Lt. Claude Laurent, Jr., who was newly field commissioned 3rd platoon and 2nd Lt. Marvin Jamison who was also newly field commissioned 2nd platoon and two unnamed platoon leaders (non-commissioned) for 1st and 4th platoon to a short meeting. I ordered the platoon leaders to prepare their men to cross the Line of Departure (L.D.) near the four corners (the intersection n68 and n827) at 0600 hours, to start moving to high ground overlooking the town of Beho.

At the Initial Point (I.P.), I met an officer from the division artillery who was waiting for F Company commander to which he was assigned and would not need an Field artillery observer (F.o.) that day. I told him it was impossible for him to join F Company and I coaxed him to join E Company since we would need an F.o. If we encountered German troops. He could have disobeyed my plea (i could not order him since he did not belong to E Company). My argument compelled him to reluctantly join our column. This is confusing to me He joined our column. Since all the orders were verbal, he was in fact supposed to be with E Company but was incorrectly assigned to F Company. He proved to be invaluable as his training was key in the coming battle. In general, we had very limited information about mounting an offensive and we were not told about the enemy situation or anything. We were totally in the dark about what to expect. And, once we got there; what to do. Unbeknownst to me at the time, \u201dluck\u201d was going to play a very important role in our success at the end of the day. I, Lt.

Of course, no flashlights could be used as this would potentially give away our position. It was also very cold with temperatures 20 below zero Fahrenheit. I had no compass and my only guide was the terrain itself. Since the objective was the high ground, I knew I must keep walking uphill. Everyone actually followed in my footsteps in the snow. The column of troops was started approximately 50 yards behind me. This also was unusual for A Company commander to lead his men on a mission. They usually had scouts to go and report back to them informing what the situation was. I, on the other hand, was the Commander, leader, and scout all in one. The situation required rapid movement to the objective because we could not afford to be discovered on our way to the objective. There was really no time or none of my superiors present to discuss this operation any further. We got only basic orders and it was on me to formulate the execution plan; we were on our own. The entire area was absolutely free of sounds and nothing was moving. I felt an uneasy calm. Further upward, I caught sight of a building; a stone farmhouse that seemed uninhabited. As I approached, I passed a German sentry without knowing it except \u201cfeeling\u201d a movement on my right side. After passing the sentry, the silence was broken by him challenging me with a German command, \u201cHalten sie!\u201d.

Looking back to that moment when I was challenged by the sentry, I was not sure if he thought I was the only one in the area or if any other american soldiers were there. He probably also was told to watch the road looking West to the town of Beho. Another lucky move on my part was having my troops (E Company) way behind me so that the sentry had no idea of being moments away from an attack by large number of enemy soldiers. The snow-suit covered men quickly moved to join me. I assigned each platoon a separate farm building to occupy and hold. This was our objective! The Germans were completely surprised and were unable to remain in the farm houses and fled to their Mark IV Panzer Tiger tanks vehicles. In fact, their sleep was interrupted. It turns out that the farm buildings were actually built from massive field stone. The easy Company, 334th objective was instantly determined when the German sentry challenged me with a command \u201cHalten sie\u201d. He was standing quietly behind a low wall beside a building which I really did not notice because it was very dark. There were no lights anywhere around. I may be walking across a paved road but with all the snow the landscape was uniformly covered. If the guard had not challenged me, I could have missed stopping at this point. The two lead platoons, 2nd and 3rd, led by newly battle field commissioned, 2nd Lt. Marvin Jamison and 2nd Lt. Clyde Laurent were directed to occupy two separate farm buildings nearby.

I had a narrow view but I could hear small arms fire outside and the loud rumbling of Mark IV shells impacting the all-stone farm structures that we occupied. The tables were turned; we became the targets. Each platoon was assigned to enter and occupy each of three barn buildings. For example, the 2nd platoon under 2nd Lt. Marvin W.W. Jamison took a barn and 3rd platoon under 2nd Lt. Clyde Laurent, Jr. Took the next barn, etc. I took my group of men to the farmhouse and threw a hand grenade into the house, thinking there might be Germans in the house.. However, upon entering, no Germans were found in the house. They were all sleeping in the barns. The second platoon burst into the barn and ran into more than 20 enemy tankers-soldiers. Tankers were not infantry. They were crew members of the mark iV\u2019s and were not ready to engage hand-to-hand in close quarters. They needed to be in their machines to fight. In the dark they were yelling, a few shots rang out, and some hand-to-hand grappling as the Americans came in one door and the Germans tried to flee out the other. Once within the farmhouse, and from an observation position on the 2nd floor which I made my makeshift command post (C.P.), I spotted the three German mark iV panzer tanks. These massive tanks war machines squatted just 75 yards to the northeast of the farmhouse. Next, they began blasting the buildings with their 88 mm high-velocity shells. The 88\u2019s were unmatched in destructive power. However, the thick walls of stone absorbed the blasts. It was becoming daylight now, about 0730 hours.

We discussed the situation in real time and quickly agreed the artillery was needed as soon as possible I asked the forward observer officer to order artillery to disperse the tanks. The F.o. Complied and successfully shelled the tanks to pull back the F.o. Used his personal radio to communicate with the artillery weapons which was several thousand yards from our position. Within minutes from calling in our position, the shells began to rain down closer than 100 yards from us. This pin-point accuracy could have easily killed us if their trajectories were off very slightly. Observing was difficult to observe the action results was difficult because the farm house had no windows on the North and south side. We could only hear the shells hitting their targets and the surrounding area.

Ivan Beams sent me a letter from his winter vacation home in Destin, Florida which gave me a vivid personal description of the action at maison de neuve. I cannot write the details like his own story. The gi\u2019s fought a desperate action, slamming fresh ammo clips into the smoking, hungry breeches of their M-1 rifles as fast as they could. The barn was riddled by small arms fire while 88 mm shells from the Panzers pulverized the stone fascade of the building. As the Germans passed closer, the men of E Company faced the very real danger of being swamped by the 20th panzer grenadiers. We were in a desperate situation. We could not fight off the incoming German soldiers. I knew that it was necessary to call for artillery down close to our own position and turned to the artillery spotter only to see him emptying a clip from his gun into his own radio. The F.o. Said to me \u201ci tell you, this situation looks hopeless. We\u2019re in trouble and I can\u2019t let the enemy get my radio\u201d.

I know now that the two 84th Division generals, general alexander Bolling and general John Church were grateful for my repelling not one but two major interruptions on the town of Beho. I bring this thought up because an observer of history will think of the battle to save the town of Beho as was not really one event, but two major events. The first event was over when the F.O. Attached to E Company shot up his radio and second event began when Lt. Morgia picked up his radio. The first event was the dispersion and destruction of the Panzer tanks and the second event was the subsequent attack by the German 30th panzer grenadiers. Now I really must point out the importance of the maison de neuve interruption. There is no doubt in my mind that the German mark iV tanks were positioned at the maison de neuve Farm area primarily to destroy the town of Beho on the morning of January 23, 1945. The town is approximately 1,000 yards away with no view obstructions in between. Looking at an old aerial photo of the town, there appears to be about 50 dwellings dispersed within the town. The reason why I am so concerned about this special story is that no one has thought how history was changed by protecting the town of Beho until this writing.

He remembers that he spent \u201cmost of the night\u201d looking for a place to sleep. He found that all the buildings (homes) were \u201cwall to wall\u201d occupied with sleeping soldiers. Pvt. William Fazioli, ended up sleeping on a washing machine. No one has ever reported this story anywhere, anytime. So, when I had stated that I may have saved 5,000 american lives that night by arriving at the maison de neuve minutes before the German tankers became alert and active, . Tthis is an accurate estimation. The facts and map evidence show that the 84th Division\u2019s two regiments 333rd and 334th took Beho that night of January 22-23, 1945. No doubt all the troops took shelter in the homes with the estimated 5000 civilians. Using the 84th Division organization information, there is approximately 3,000 men per regiments, theoretically, 6,000 men sleeping in town wherever there was spaceor less could be involved.

The most compelling thought for this whole campaign really has to do with the counter attack ordered by the German high command to the Commander of the 20th Panzer Grenadiers. Undoubtedly, the commander of the 20th Panzer was familiar with the 84th Division\u2019s powerful machine and that it would likely return to the Linnich Roer River area to penetrate his homeland (Germany) rather than \u201cretreat\u201d from the Maison de Neuve complex after the silencing of the Mark IV tanks, whose mission was to \u201cdisrupt\u201d the 333rd and 334th Infantry Regiments while they occupied the town of Beho.

After a tactical exercise, a critique meeting allows the attendees to voice their opinion. In this forum, everyone has an opportunity to voice his constructive criticism of the operation. There is always room for criticism in that since combat involves many risks and unknowns, the law of probability can heavily influence the outcome. For instance, the field officer\u2019s decision to destroy his radio, SCR- #300. In hindsight was not a good one. His emotions controlled his decisionmaking. Yes, he was following s.o.p. (standard operating procedure) but was early in executing it. It is known that a good officer follows orders from his commander. This officer\u2019s estimate of the situation considered that the 20th ss grenadier counter attack on the maison de neuve was a surprise and E Company soldiers were in serious danger of being neutralized. I was next to the field observer in our command post (CP) when this happened. The command post was located on the second floor of the farmhouse. The farmhouse was slightly behind the barns. However, the lucky part of this choice to establish a Cp here was that it had a great view of the road leading from the occupied town of aldringen due east (see map) of our position. This road led to the town of Beho due West. No one expected a counter attack by the German troops, but as I stated before I saw the leading trooper with a burp gun through my field glasses.

This was indeed my eighth lucky move What were the first seven lucky moves??\u2013 the precision and timing could not have been better. The Germans at that moment were demotivated and demoralized and had to rethink seriously where they were treading.

I welcomed Lieut. William W thompson back from his three-day Paris pass. The next thing I remembered was being in the town of Houffalize, about 5 miles southwest of Beho, waiting for several days to assemble troops to return north to eygelshoven, Holland. The 334th regimental convoy used red ball express 2 1\u20442 ton trucks to move the men on a secret trip without headlights at night. The Company E convoy of trucks met the mainline of the regimental truck convoy without the last truck of E Company group. I was in that last truck with kitchen personnel in back and alongside the driver in a kitchen cook, teC 5 sgt. William J. Cesa, Cleveland, ohio, who was ill. The reason why the last E Company truck became missing was due to the hairpin turns of roads in the Houffalize town area where we stayed. The trailer filled with kitchen equipment could not negotiate the sharp turns. It took time with my assistance to work up the ravine. My truck must have been about one hour late for our rendezvous with the main convoy. It was very dark but we drove north. On this dark night, my red ball truck with the kitchen personnel and a trailer full of kitchen equipment was traveling due north on unmarked roads and without travel lights. It was very quiet and monotonous except when I was whistling to keep the driver alert and when I was humoring my sick kitchen cook.

The eygelshoven, Holland area was used as an assembly position for the 84th division troops. The move was made in secrecy \u2013 so all shoulder patches and unit insignia were removed. The townspeople billeted the men in neat houses. All the Dutch civilians were very friendly. Some of the g.i.\u2019s had taken extra food from the kitchen\u2019s chow line to feed families with whom they were billeted. I had a picture taken of myself outside one of these Dutch homes. Importantly enough, we later found that the Germans knew we were there and the German broadcasting element from radio arnheim welcomed the 84th infantry Division back to the ninth army front the day after our arrival. I have a good idea that the German High Command (gHC) concluded this scenario when the Battle of the Bulge was coming to a close. The huge counterattack that we witnessed at the maison de neuve farm complex was an attempt by the GHC, seeing the end insight, to inflict destruction on the 333rd and 334th regiments gathered within the homes of Beho.

For the role in which we played. That is the only reason for me to write this book. I feel, from my first-hand account, that the war in Europe was shortened by at least 30 days.

The circumstances came together in a way that could not have been absolutely planned by any commanding rank nor by anyone without foresight of what was to likely happen. We played our part.

Most of the E Company commissioned officers and noncommissioned officers were killed in action (KIA or injured. Our Company commander,Capt. James D. Ledbetter, georgia, was injured in the arm.

Since, the trajectory was low, I thought that it was an \u201c88\u201d. These were high velocity 88 mm diameter shells fired from mobile vehicle. The same munitions are used to knock-out tanks or high flying aircraft. I never was under such fire before,but I did read about in army literature. My immediate action was to move from the \u201cranged-spot\u201d and seek deeper protection in an \u201coff-range\u201d area. I ran and found an air force bomb crater and jumped into the shallow recess. Shortly, thereafter, two more \u201c88\u201d\u2019s hit near the edge of the crater. I remained still for about five minutes. I stuck my head up to see where the firing was coming from and got two more 88\u2019s shells in the same spot. The edge of the crater helped to deflect the exploding shell blast upward and avoid hitting me with shrapnel. At this moment I just laid flat with my face up, eyes closed, and played dead. I lay motionless, without moving a single eye lash for twenty or so minutes. My only thought was that some artillery observer ahead of my position was checking the results of his fire mission and if I moved,he would try again to finish his \u201ctarget\u201d.

We are together again as a team. We are now in direct contact and working together,side by side. This is a fantastic coupling because we were first brought together about 6 months ago at Camp Claibourne, La. And lived in a doubles hutment. We were from the opposite ends of the social ladder.

My parents emigrated from rome and napoli area of Italy and met and married in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Nine months later, I was born as the first son.

Theodore Draper\u2019s the 84th infantry Division in the Battle of germany, New York, the Viking press, 1946. Now in the public domain.\nIn a sense, the crossing was begun with the feints on the two nights before the jump-off. On the night of February 20-21. The concentration was fired from 2 am. To 2:05 am. At the crossing site. A two-hour smoke screen was also laid along the far shore. On the night of February 21-22, this concentration was repeated but the time was changed to 5 a.m. And the place was changed to farther upstream. The smoke screen lasted most of the night to permit the engineers to work near the river bank. As prisoners related later, the crossing was expected on both these nights and the enemy stayed on a very nervous alert but he dropped his guard when it failed to materialize. On the night of February 22-23, under cover of the smoke screen, the 309th engineers cleared the routes to the river and marked them with tracing tape.

Company C lost two boats, dragged downstream by the swift current into some burp gun fire. Many boats, however, drifted 75-100 yards downstream in the strong current; this was important because it was impossible to return them in the dark to the west bank to bring across the second crossing battalion. The two companies crossed on a front of approximately 700 yards. The boat trip took about ten minutes. The second wave of boats, bearing Company B and Company D, hit the water at 3:45 am. By 4:05 a.m., the entire 1st Battalion was safely across. The casualties were negligible. Once across, the troops hit the shore, dropped their rubber life belts, and headed for the railroad track, about 400 yards away, where they had to put together the platoons and companies, split up in the boats for the crossing. Everyone expected the run to the railroad track to be one of the nastiest moments in the job. \u201cWhat the boys were the most afraid of was the expected mine fields across the river,\u201d T/Sgt.

Hawkins explained why their fears were not realized: \u201cWe went right through a field full of stake mines but all the trip wires attached to the mines had been cut by our artillery and mortars, and not one of the mines exploded in spite of the fact that some of the boys even stumbled over the mines themselves.\u201d the 1st Battalion changed directions as soon as it hit the railroad track.

The very lack of contact indicated that the enemy was lying low but we could not count on that forever. Should the 1st Battalion hold up and mop up the bridgehead or should it push on with all possible speed, leaving the mopping up for the 3rd Battalion which was next to cross? It was not a one-sided argument. If the 1st Battalion mopped up, the bridgehead would be safer but the entire drive might have bogged down and the enemy in K\u00f6rrenzig and farther back might have been given a chance to recover and get set. If the 1st Battalion went ahead without mopping up, an accident or an upset at the bridgehead for the 3rd Battalion might have had disastrous consequences if the follow-up units could not get through in time to assist the 1st. Either way, risks were unavoidable. The important thing was that we were playing for the highest stakes\u2014a major break-through. We were determined to pass through the crust of German resistance into the soft open spaces in the enemy\u2019s rear and develop a momentum which could carry us clear to the Rhine or at least most of the way. To achieve a break-through of such dimensions, only one kind of risk was permissible. It was necessary to race ahead at all costs, to take the fullest advantage of the element of surprise which had already helped us so much in the crossing, to keep the enemy off balance and confused. So the 1st Battalion did not wait to mop up the far bank. It stayed near the bridgehead only long enough to reorganize, and drove for K\u00f6rrenzig, 1500 yards away, before dawn.

This fire from the enemy\u2019s side was not very heavy, at least not until approximately 5:30 a.m., but in the usual amount of harassing fire, a number of lucky hits were scored. As a result, none of the footbridges were in when the 334th\u2019s 3rd Battalion had to cross. At the same time, all the assault boats had not returned from the east bank because so many had drifted downstream. Under fire and in the darkness, it was impossible to recover them in time for the 3rd Battalion. The fate of the first three footbridges and the assault boats necessarily delayed the 3rd Battalion\u2019s crossing. The aggressiveness of the 334th\u2019s 1st Battalion is worth some notice. Companies a and C moved into K\u00f6rrenzig at 6:10 a.m. The 3rd Battalion started to cross the river at 6:45 a.m. In other words, the 1st Battalion had attacked its first town, approximately 2000 yards from the crossing site, before the 3rd Battalion had even begun to cross.

In fact, the town was much less troublesome than a marsh and a canal through which they had to wade knee deep to get to it. By the time they were ready to break into the town, everyone was wet, uncomfortable, and angry. Nevertheless, the artillery was still doing a good deal of the work. Just before entering. The infantry called for a special five-minute artillery concentration on K\u00f6rrenzig. Then Company C took the side of the town nearest the river, Company A the side away from the river. It was still quite dark. Company C ran into one machine gun which held up the advance temporarily. One rifle grenade and one bazooka round cleared the way. Prisoners were picked up obviously shell-shocked. A German officer gave himself up to Company A in the very first street.

Ever since its own crossing, the 3rd Battalion had been cleaning out nests of resistance bypassed by the 1st Battalion. At 6:30 p.m., as night was falling, it moved out of rurich toward Baal. Company K started out on the left, Company L on the right, Company I in reserve. The road passed by a large chateau, then a clearing, then a large patch of woods, another clearing, and finally ran into Baal. About 300 yards from the chateau to the right was a pillbox, skillfully camouflaged as a haystack. The first sign of life in the haystack was a burst of fire. As soon as the pillbox opened up, Companies L and K drew back to the chateau. Two bazooka teams were sent after the pillbox. Meanwhile, mortars made a bonfire out of the hay, emptying the pillbox and saving the bazookas the trouble. The companies made a fresh start. It was almost dark. Ahead was the patch of woods. In those woods, for the first time, the enemy showed that the element of surprise was gone and that he was reacting to the attack.

Four tanks or assault guns were destroyed, two damaged, and the six personnel carriers knocked out. The remaining tanks or assault guns withdrew toward Baal after dark. The rest of the march from rurich to Baal was relatively easy. At the outskirts of Baal, the infantry held up while the artillery concentrated on the town for ten minutes. The doughboys moved into another dazed village. The occupation of Baal was swift. Some burp guns sounded off in the main street but resistance in general was light. By 9:15 p.m., the town was cleared. For the moment, the outlook was bright. We had estimated that Baal could be taken on D-plus-l, that is, on February 24, so that on this first day we were ahead of schedule. We were also considerably ahead of the divisions on either side so that our flanks were completely exposed, except for the location of our reserves to meet possible counterattacks. The second regiment to cross, the 335th infantry, started over the footbridge at 4:15 pm. And was completely across before midnight, the 1st Battalion in rurich, the 2nd Battalion between rurich and K\u00f6rrenzig, and the 3rd Battalion in K\u00f6rrenzig. Our bridgehead, stretching approximately 31\u20442 miles from Linnich to Baal, was occupied by two full infantry regiments before D-Day was finished. All that day, however, bridges, communications, and contact were still problems. The infantry support bridge was started at 9 am. And opened for traffic by 5:30 pm.

The weapons companies had been able to bring across only as much as they could carry by hand, namely, heavy machine guns, 81 mm. Mortars, and some mines.

Waving and yelling, several men tried to warn the tanks away from the machine gun fire. The enemy tankers let them have an extra burst of lead in return.

The situation became so critical that there was nothing left to do but to call down artillery on that very spot. I had no radio communications so I sent runners to the company Cp but they never got there. Lucky for us, the company commander had received word from somewhere else that there was trouble and he called for artillery on the underpass. For an hour the underpass was shelled and my platoon sweated it out in our house which was only 25 yards away.\u201d this artillery treatment saved the 2nd platoon. All through the night our men could hear the Germans near the underpass crying out, begging for the shelling to be lifted. One German-speaking gi yelled at them to surrender. In small groups, they charged across the road to give themselves up. Some dragged or carried wounded. In the end, about 25 prisoners were jammed in the already crowded cellar of the house. They claimed that they were the only ones left of the 200 or more men who had started the attack from granterath. Then the artillery was lifted. Company L\u2019s 1st platoon had a similar experience. First the second squad was surrounded. The Germans called on them to surrender. The Bar man opened up and managed to cover the squad\u2019s escape. The third squad was less fortunate. It was surrounded in a house, the Germans told them to give up, a well-placed hand grenade talked back. German bazookas forced them to jump upstairs. They could not see what was going on outside but they kept flinging out hand grenades and firing rifles to discourage an assault on the house. For awhile, there was a stalemate; the enemy could not get into the house and they could not get out. Finally, artillery arrived.

The 2nd was ordered to move through rurich to the northwest, cutting across country to strike directly at Doveren. The 2nd also hit resistance almost immediately from entrenched enemy infantry along the Brachelen-Baal railroad. Instead of holding up, however, it swung over to the right as far as the western edge of Baal and bypassed the whole thing.

It immediately launched an attack, using its entire complement of tanks. The 76\u2018s fired away over the heads of our own infantry. Both tanks and infantry broke through. In Doveren, the tanks again played a leading role. At first the command tank and two other tanks were cut off in the center of the town. When the infantry was delayed, it was necessary to dismount the crews to protect the tanks. By nightfall, the infantry had control of the situation and the tanks were freed to take up positions to the north to guard against counterattacks.

In the case of Doveren, the 2nd Company, 343rd infantry, did not launch the counterattack at all. The 1st Battalion, 351st Volksgrenadiers, 183rd Volksgradier Division, passed through it at about 2:80 a.m. On the morning of February 25 to do the fighting. The enemy\u2019s attack was vigorous but it was too little and too late. We already had two full infantry battalions and one full tank company in Doveren. The counterattack was thrown back by an unusually neat triple play which showed the high degree of co-ordination which our infantry-tank-artillery forces had reached. It was the practice of the 771st Tank Battalion to send one staff officer with a radio to the artillery battalion in direct support of the infantry regiment with which one of the tank companies was working. In this case, the 335th infantry and the 771st\u2019S Company C were involved. This liaison officer stayed in the fire direction center to work in the closest relationship with the artillery. In this way, each tank became a forward observer for the artillery and each tanker could adjust the artillery\u2019 s fire. When the 1st Battalion, 351st Volksgrenadiers, hit Doveren, Company C\u2019s tanks had radio communication with the infantry but the artillery did not. On the other hand, the tanks could get through to their liaison officer in the fire direction center. For approximately four hours, Captain B. C. Mills of Company C directed artillery fire on the enemy\u2019s counterattack and eventually broke it up. By daybreak, Doveren was safe from everything but the enemy\u2019s artillery.

Thus on this third day of our drive, we began to detect signs of greatly increasing disintegration in the enemy\u2019s ranks. Volkssturm elements were encountered for the first time but were committed as replacements for the 183rd Volksgrenadier Division, not as a unit. This division seemed on the verge of complete disintegration as prisoners from every one of its regiments increased. Many were sent into the line so frantically that they did not know to what company they belonged. Confusion was gradually but unmistakeable setting in. There were strong indications that the enemy\u2019s organized defense extended only as far as Baal and Doveren. At Baal, also, we apparently forced him to displace an important portion of his artillery. He was handicapped, therefore, for two or three days before he could bring his guns into new positions. In any case, we had three days of hard fighting. After D-plus-2, there was a distinct change.\n\nCHAPTER 7 PASS TO PARIS\nI now share my personal experience in this chapter.

Thompson, commander of the company, crossed the Roer river on a foot walk pontoon bridge with his Company on February 23, 1945, we all had advanced to a wooded area outside of the town of Baal, germany.

Thompson and I shared a sweltering room with no windows in the middle of a summer day in 1944. It was the only room available in town. Upon my arrival in Paris, I felt feverish stayed around the hotel enjoying the donuts and coffee made available there. The hotel dining room had huge fancy tables. However, the food was army grade since the army had taken over the whole hotel for r&r (rest and recreation). It was still very special compared to the rations or the occasional hot meal our cooks prepared for us in theater. The few things that I recall during my short time in Paris were the taxi tours of the city and museum visits. I did, however, walk some of their famous streets. I never went up the Eiffel tower though. Sleeping in a big, luxurious bed was like heaven. As a matter of fact, the whole time in Paris seemed unreal, but it was over too soon.

Theodore Draper\u2019s the 84th infantry Division in the Battle of Germany, New York, the Viking press, 1946.\nThe breakthrough is probably the most rewarding achievement of modern ground warfare. It has been made possible by the speed and firepower of modern weapons and equipment. It is an unmistakable demonstration that those weapons have been exploited to the fullest. The German triumph in the west in 1940 was decided by the breakthrough from sedan to abbeville. The allies turned the tables in 1944 by the breakthrough from normandy to the German border. Every one of the decisive victories in the war, on both western and eastern fronts, has involved in some form, a breakthrough. The reason is paradoxical. In modern warfare, both sides are usually able to mass so much force that a knockdown, drag-out fight may end without a real victor. It may he so exhausting that both sides have to give themselves a period of recuperation before they can go at each other again.

A major breakthrough was one of the few important military operations which the 84th had not yet experienced.

At about 3 pm, it was decided to commit the entire 1st Battalion, 334th infantry, against the threat which amounted to four anti-tank guns and five assault guns. Meanwhile, the \u201crear\u201d areas of the column were also warm. An experience of general Church showed how fluid the situation could be 3-4 miles behind the tank spearhead. When the column was held up near steeg, general Church decided to go up there to see for himself. His party was made up of three jeeps, his own, an i, and r jeep, and a third, some distance behind, with two newspaper correspondents. About 400 yards north of Wegberg a burst of fire suddenly came from the I and R jeep. A German soldier was firing back 10 feet away from a ditch. About 300 yards farther, eight more were dug in along theroad. Two jeeps raced past, everyone shooting, hoping this was an isolated, die-hard group of Germans. When still more enemy riflemen were encountered, however, it was decided to go back because it was impossible to tell how many more were waiting along the road. Meanwhile, the correspondents had turned back at the first sign of trouble to bring help. By turning around, general Church\u2019s jeep became the leading vehicle. Halfway through the first pocket of resistance, the two jeeps were caught in heavy fire from the other side of the road. 01: the way up, they had not noticed that both sides of the road were alive with Germans.

The fight against the anti-tank guns took up the rest of the day. When darkness set in and the movement of our armor was restricted, the infantry organized a defense line south of Steeg. The first day of Task Force Church was finished. What was our achievement? On February 27, the 84th infantry Division led the allied armies in the drive to the Rhine. Its breakthrough was the first of its kind by any division, armored or infantry, in the battle of Germany. By running away with the enemy, we had also run away from our friends.

The 35th infantry Division on our left had taken gerderhahn, approximately 7 miles behind us.

Hordes simply decided that the war was over for them and started marching in column to the rear. Most of these pessimistic characters were not fighting men. They were clerks, shoemakers, tailors, blacksmiths, butchers. Some were just banded rifles and told to defend a ditch which they never found. Others were caught as we overran rear echelons. Artillerymen were also unusually numerous. Replacement units were captured intact before they could turn themselves into combat units. In fact, cohesive units with definite sectors were unknown. The remnants seemed to amount to groups of men thrown together wherever they could be found. It was almost useless to pump prisoners for information. They were confused, stunned, ignorant.

It was one of the easiest and quickest victories in our experience. The surprise was absolute. About 300 yards out of Boisheim, K Company, in the lead, stopped to take care of two anti-tank guns. The information was given to them by a child at a farmhouse. The guns were seized without protest. Boisheim itself was asleep. In order to take prisoners, gi\u2019s had to raid houses on a grand scale. Boisheim produced more prisoners in bed than any other place in the drive. By 6:30 a.m., march 1, Boisheim was ours. Yet, the approaches to Boisheim were covered by anti-tank guns with excellent fields of fire. These weapous might have given us as much trouble as the guns at the approaches to Waldniel but that night they were not even manned. Boisheim is a convenient midway point to look back at the entire drive. In six days, the 84th infantry Division had advanced 20 miles from the Roer.

If the enemy had been permitted to reorganize his positions even once, there might have been a different story.\nAt the Rhine\nBoisheim was one of the turning points in the drive to the Rhine. From the Roer to Boisheim, we were traveling northward instead of eastward. The enemy was fooled because we seemed to be going away from the Rhine, our obvious objective, and his disposition of troops and defenses were primarily aimed to defend the Rhine against a drive to the east. This northward direction, however, enabled us to break out of the area of the enemy\u2019s prepared defenses in a relatively short time and to strike out into relatively open country in which armor was most effective. We had fine roads to roll on. We were cutting across corps and even armies, always at the weakest points, so that by the time the element of surprise was lost in one zone we were able to take advantage of it in another. When Boisheirn was reached, it was clear that a change of direction was indicated in order to confuse the enemy once more. After 20 miles of the northward push, it was safe to assume that the Germans had adjusted themselves to the threat from that direction. At Boisheim, therefore, the drive was suddenly twisted to the east. There was reason to suspect that the enemy might be surprised again by the change in direction and that he would again permit us to maneuver behind his lines. The great advantage of this strategy was that it forced the enemy to fight on our terms, not us on his. It was a complete reversal of the situation in the siegfried Line.

The change of direction from north to east seemed to catch the enemy by surprise again and few organized enemy units were encountered on the way. But not for long.

The column drove right into the northern sector of Krefeld without incident. Krefeld was quiet. The nazis were not even able to defend an industrial center with a normal population of 160,000. In fact, the city fell so quickly that the municipal electric and water systems were still working. For the first time in Germany, 84th men saw running water.

From oedt, this column went to Kempen, about 3 miles northeast. One of the strangest scenes in the campaign was witnessed in Kempen. As the column entered the town from the south, a few bursts of burp gun fire greeted the leading vehicles. The infantry and tanks immediately opened up. The column roared through the streets to the square in the heart of the town. In a church on that square, services were in progress. As the column passed by, everyone in the church came out, knelt on the steps of the church, and waved at our men with everything from white handkerchiefs to white sheets.

But that afternoon, a telephone call from higher headquarters forced us to make a lightning change in plan. It was the cause of the 84th\u2019s greatest disappointment in the entire battle of germany. On March 2, the 84th was in a position to capture the first bridge across the Rhine. The Uerdingen bridge was still intact. In fact, the enemy was still using it. The staff had drawn up all the necessary plans and instructions for the plunge to the river and the establishment of a firm bridgehead on the other side. About 2500 yards east of the Rhine was a first-rate road. That was the objective. Even if the Uerdingen bridge was blown after the crossing, we were in a position to build another bridge because we held the high ground on the western bank. Lt. Col. Channon, 6-4, had arranged for planes to drop food and ammunition, if that proved necessary. The entire mission was approved by higher headquarters. A field order was issued. A special task force was organized, the emphasis on speed and power. It included an infantry regiment, the 334th, a whole tank battalion, the 77st.and a tank destroyer company. The 334th had been given a full day\u2019s rest at Boisheim. This drive was set for 2 pm.

The sergeant in the lead tank handed him a thin cigar, saying: \u201cHere, general, smoke this. Give me one across the Rhine.\u201d an mp detachment had cleared the road as far as Krefeld. The task force moved out. The tanks worked up to 25 miles an hour. A few minutes later, the call came through. It was relayed to general Bolling by the chief of staff, Colonel Truman.

General Bolling asked for reconsideration. The order was repeated. Homberg was not even on general Bolling\u2019s map at that moment. It was too late to stop the Rhine-bound task force. One of the hardest and most dangerous maneuvers in the art of war was obligatory. It was necessary to reroute a huge column in motion. At the same time, it was neces- sary to make an immediate and equally far-reaching change in the work of the other two columns. Originally, the 335th had to take half of Krefeld, the 333rd had to protect the left flank of Krefeld, and the 334th had to drive through to the Uerdingen Bridge. Now, all three columns had to do something else. General Bolling had to call all three regimental commanders on a moment\u2019s notice, direct them to change their course, and give them altogether new missions about 10 miles away in a zone which they had never even considered. It was an intense, heartbreaking moment. General Bolling put through the calls. He gave the orders. The regimental commanders were barely able to believe their ears. The switch was made. The Uerdingen Bridge was swiftly forgotten. New maps were hunted up frantically. All eyes turned north, to Hornberg.\nNorth Again\nIn our new sector, two bridges spanned the Rhine.

This type was known as a steel candelabra truss type bridge. On march 2, while the 335th was moving on Krefeld, the 334th took charge of the new mission to Homberg. Its objective was the admiral scheer Bridge. In order to get there as quickly as possible, this column was ordered to bypass Krefeld and to strike out to the north from st. Tonia. Once its job in Krefeld was finished, the 835th could move up from behind, pass through the rear of the 334th, and take a longer route on the left flank to the Baerl Railroad Bridge. The two bridges were about 3 miles apart. The 333rd was sent into Krefeld. It is interesting to note that the 334th had to fight its way out of St. Tonia, although the 335th had already passed through it. This was typical of the action from the Roer to the Rhine. The leading elements would advance along the main routes and reconnaissance elements would cover the flanks on the secondary routes. Nevertheless, pockets of enemy troops were often met by the units that followed up in the same general direction and no march was entirely uneventful. In this case, the 334th arrived in st.

C. Mills, commander of the 77lst\u2019S Company C. Once more, an advance that was stalled in the daylight was not held up for more daylight but was started off again at night on a round-the-clock basis. The success of this maneuver was one of the outstanding features of the entire drive. Again and again the enemy was powerless to stop us because he could not see us or because he was not prepared to do anything about it. By daylight, we were far out of reach, he was cut off, and apt to give up or to fight with much less enthusiasm against the second or third wave. By daylight, march 3, this column got as far as Klied, 5000 yards from the pocket at ortsmannsheide. The most interesting stretch of this part of the trip was the road between the villages of inrath and Klied. Apparently a German minelaying detail was always one lap ahead of the advance. Five different hasty mine fields were encountered and it seemed that we were removing them a few minutes after they were laid. Fortunately, a large enemy ammunition dump was blazing away in the vicinity and its bright flames furnished some light. At Klied, the 334th\u2019s 3rd Battalion, supported by the 771st\u2019S Company a, took the lead.

This mission was given to elements of the 15th panzer grenadier Division, the 406th Division, and miscellaneous paratroop units.

That morning the enemy was holding only a 4-mile bridgehead, but the very momentum of our advance tended to throw us into sharp conflict against his relatively large forces that were jammed into the bridgehead, trying to escape over the bridges to the east bank. To follow the final drive, it will simplify matters to start with the unit that succeeded in reaching the Rhine first. At daylight, march 4, the 335th\u2019s 2nd Battalion, which had sweated it out at the Bettenkamp road junction during the night, moved out toward mors. It went through the southern part of the town without encountering more than scattered snipers who surrendered quite readily. A good deal of mortar fire, however, hit the town from the north. The first solid resistance was met at meerbeck, a half mile east of mors, about noon. From meerbeck, the Baerl railroad Bridge, its objective, was visible. A steady stream of traffic, mainly horse-drawn artillery, trucks, and many foot troops, was crossing over. Our artillery was called to put a stop to that. Time fire exploded into great flame-red flower-clusters of steel above the bridge, darting from the west bank to the east bank and back again. Several vehicles were knocked out and only foot troops tried to get across. But still the enemy did not blow the bridge. Along the river were three railroad embankments. All of them were heavily defended and anti-tank guns covered all the possible approaches. At about 1 pm., Company B loaded on tanks and tried to charge up to the bridge but the anti-tank guns opened up and the tanks had to pull-back. About a dozen men of Company E, however, did reach the Rhine at 1:25 p.m., the first in the division to do so.

Soon after, at 8 pm, the bridge was finally blown. It was still used by enemy foot troops until about 1 a.m., march 5, however, when a second explosion was heard. Company E came to the bridge area two hours later and confirmed that the bridge had crashed into the Rhine. The 335th\u2019s 3rd Battalion came to the Rhine with somewhat more difficulty. At 9:30 p.m., march 4, it was ordered out of meerbeck to seize a road junction at Lohmannsheide about a mile northwest of the bridge, which the enemy was using to withdraw from the north. As a result, although the Germans were bent on retreat across the river rather than resistance on the west bank, they held that area in much greater strength than elsewhere.

East of the Rhine are three principal rivers; the Weser, Leine, and elbe. The area is generally lowland of undulating planes with two ridges, or high ground system, passing through it. The offense from the Rhine to the Weser, about 100 miles, was made in four days by most of the 84th division. After Weser river crossing, it experienced more clashes with the enemy. The main fighting took place at roadblocks that were hastily set up. The efficiency of the roadblocks depended on the covering fire for which, at best, was limited. They failed to hold up the advance of the combat troops. The average time for tearing down the block was 20 minutes, or more, for elaborate blocks. The task Force Church was motorized so that every unit moved like one part of a continuous train. However, there were many stop and go events. I remembered riding in the front seat of a Jeep. There was an endless number of stops. The stops varied in time length. I vaguely recollect where we were and what I did during that period, due to an increased lack of sleep. We were always in the vicinity of the vehicle. No enemy fire was encountered as we passed through the small towns along the way. Of course, everyone riding on jeeps or in 2 1/2 ton truck transports were armed and ready to respond to any trouble. Currently the military government section under maj. Frank green, and our counterintelligence detachment, under Lieut. Charles rountree, began to work overtime to set up responsible local leaders to maintain order.

We had been moving continuously all night, and the armor leading the column was manned by quiet soldiers. As the Germans slept behind blackout shutters they heard the sound of our armor and did not hear any noises of battle. It was natural for them to believe the sounds they heard were their panzer divisions moving about to meet the American offensive. The next morning the civilians opened their shutters amazedly to find American soldiers building fires along the road and cooking emergency rations. A few soldiers knocked on the door and asked for warm water for coffee and shaving. Wehrmacht rear echelon troops were awakened with varying gentleness from their beds, told to dress, and sent to pW cages at the rear of the convoy.

I\u2019m not sure how fast I was walking, but at one point of this advance, I noticed the German\u2019s autobahn road system ahead. Our road system passed underneath the autobahn. I saw a huge tiger tank, mark V, on our road (under the autobahn highway). Of course, my next move was to detour from our road and bypass the tank by walking over onto the autobahn and reentering the road on the other side of the tank. This simple maneuver was an instant reaction in a situation where many lives would be lost trying to overcome a tiger tank. There was no inaudible way to discuss this unexpected enemy incursion for proper action. The consequence of a wrong decision to overcome a mark iV tank with protection overhead, would have invited them to turn their massive gun on our lined-up column of soldiers. It would have been very difficult and time-consuming to direct the counter fire necessary to destroy the Mark IV tank. The episode ending in a very peaceful manner \u2013 after over half of the task force troops passed the autobahn \u2013 as the light of day appeared and some curious troops walked by the mark iV tank and heard the sound of sleeping crew members.

The light of day became bright as we cautiously walked in a quiet city. There was no interference and there were a lot of white flags in some of the un-bombed building windows. Hanover was one of the most bombedout cities in germany. The devastation was widespread, but everyone cooperated.

After traveling several hours of departure, I received orders to return to Hannover and organize a replacement depot to lecture new troops, unfamiliar with combat. The facility was in a German Kaserne \u201cbarracks\u201d building. I remember talking to new troops and explaining how to cope and stay alive on the battlefield. There was no formal curriculum guidelines. Everything was in an impromptu manner. This assignment did not last very long, because by april 13 the war would be over and there would be no need for replacements or training. My off-duty times were spent visiting the town\u2019s area close by with a regiment of 333rd American troops. I bought some art supplies in a nearby i.g. Farber factory. I also remember visiting the cellar of the German Kaserne and found thousands of detailed maps of russia. Apparently, Hannover could have been the source of such printed matter.

In the meantime, the 84th Division experienced a lightning move on the last leg, going from Hannover to the Elbe river in three days. The attached map indicates a distance of 80 miles. Note that a total distance from the Rhine river to the Elbe river is approximately 250 miles. So, from april 1, 1945, the starting date on the Rhine, to the ending date on the elbe, April 13, 1945, only about 13 days elapsed. The first segment\u2019s coverage per day, from the Rhine to the Leine river, was 17 miles. From the Leine river to Elbe river the average speed was 26 miles per day.

However, the 335th, and myself, were left in Hannover as a XIII Army Corps reserve.

Alexander Bolling had been playing with the idea for so long that only the remaining details needed to be finalized. The attitude among the Command had set our objectives in terms of miles not yards. We were thinking in terms of task forces; a miniature Division. Each infantry regimental unit had its own tanks, artillery, engineers, and air observers. The result was task Force Church.

In hindsight, the payoff of the breakthrough on February 27 spared many american and German lives. Not only did it save lives but the war in Europe was shortened, in my estimation, by at least one month.

The priority was to provide exchange services for thousands of troops in Europe. The aes in Germany would have to replace civilian facilities.

Our family never owned an automobile so we either walked, biked, or rode the bus from town to town. One summer day, I took a leisurely ride on my bike on a sharp turn downhill road which converged with the main road along the side of the river. I was more focused on the river as I coasted down the hill. At the same time, an automobile was touring and keeping on the right side and did not see me because of the road\u2019s elevation. I did not see the automobile and the driver didn\u2019t see me until the last moment when the car hit my bike head-on with the right fender.

In 1941, when I was 19 years old, I found a job as a carpenter\u2019s helper with the Hardy Construction company, in stratford, Connecticut. Instead of hammering nails, I spent most of my time digging water pipe and drainage trenches to the house and other heavy-duty work like pouring freshly mixed concrete, with a deep wheelbarrow, on a gang plank runway to make a foundation for the building. One day while carrying two heavy one-third square of roof shingles to the top roof section of the two-story building, I started to slip off the roof and one of the Hardy boys yelled \u201cspread wing\u201d. I spread out on the roof to maximize the surface area and, hence, increase my friction with the roof. It averted me from sliding down off the roof to the ground below which was a drop of twenty feet.

I felt compelled to pay them back by being \u201calice\u2019s alarm Clock\u201d; calling her every morning and driving her to work. She was overworked by taking care of her aging parents and two grandchildren. It was the least I could do! The next year, 1942, when I was 19 years old, I found another demanding job. It was a no-brainer job but it required a lot of muscle and stamina. It was at an asphalt mixing plant in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Ordinarily, this plant which processed clean sand by heating it in a large revolving kiln and mixing it with a hot liquid petroleum product to make hot asphalt. This was dropped into a dump truck positioned below the mixing chamber. The extraordinary circumstance with this job was that the company, godfrey asphalt plant, was contracted to pave the town of stratford\u2019s airport runway. It was an all summer job where 150 tons of mixed hot asphalt material was required each day. Now, me and a young son of the foreman, named John Desouza, had to shovel this vast amount of sand into a continuous chain of buckets from an overhead sand storage bin. This was one hot summer with plenty of overtime. I did not know it at the time but I was essentially in training for the war that was brewing in Europe. This is postpearl Harbor where in Bridgeport the Chance-Voight company was building Corsair fighter aircraft and an airport was urgently needed.

I had my share of close calls involved in my civilian life. While studying for my masters degree at New York University in 1948, I decided to take a job with the edcan laboratories in norwalk Connecticut. I was now 26 years old and still did not have a driver\u2019s license. I had to take a train to commute to my workplace and classes in New York City. Every chemical product that we chemists produced at edcan laboratory for delivery to our customers was made in batches. There was no assembly line, just a worktable for each chemist to mix and react chemicals that resulted in an end product. Some batches may create fumes that must be made in a special exhaust hood with wired safety glass sliding doors. I cannot forget being by the side of my fellow chemist, Dr. Charles stern. I left the room for a smoke on the front steps and there was a loud explosion. Charles\u2019 twenty-two liter batch of chemicals exploded, spewing chemicals and glass about the laboratory. Later, I visited him in a New York hospital and he had vision problems which resulted from the blast. I cannot help but think what would have happened to me if I had not gone out for a smoke.

A given volume of sample liquid was pipetted into a test tube to determine the concentration. This particular liquid had poisonous cyanide in it. The problem occurred while mouth-pipetting the sample, the tip of the pipette came out of the solution, making the cyanide solution volatile in the column.

One of the few times I had to evict a tenant was when this nice person, norman, said he could not pay his rent that month because someone had robbed his delivery truck causing the owner to deduct it from his pay. Later on he lost his job and could not pay his rent so I had to evict him. During the eviction, his son broke into the sheriff\u2019s car parked in front of the apartment house and stole the sheriff\u2019s cash which was laying on the front seat. Upon cleaning-out the apartment, I found over 200 empty crack cocaine vials in the apartment cabinet. This was more disturbing to me in that he misrepresented himself to me as an honest person. But, giving it more thought, I realized that he was the victim of his own weakness. I felt a duty to stay with the apartments because my father bought these houses with the money he had saved working as a steam-operated electromagnetic crane to pick up scrap metal from a river barge and load gondolas for trips to melting furnaces at the stanley Works plants. Many times the replacement worker would not show up and the foreman mr. Scheyd was happy that my father would do double duty. I still remember walking over to him a plate of spaghetti and meatballs at times when he was doing triple duty (a period of 24 hours).

I became a responsible person early in life. When my parents were working their jobs, I would keep the house clean and take care of the garbage. I scrubbed floors at times on my hands and knees. I even helped my father paint the kitchen and bathroom. The landlord only offered free paint; green and dark brown. My father painted the kitchen green all over and I painted the bathroom cubicle dark brown. Most of the time I volunteered to help. Sometimes it was a direct order. In the pre-teen years, when weather got real cold, I would get newspaper and stuff the windows to preserve the little heat available in our four room railroad, slum apartment. On my own, I would collect kindling wood during the year to save for starting kitchen stove fires with authentic coal. Of course, I had to take care of the ashes from the fire. When cold got colder we would put blanket covered chairs around the stove and make popcorn. The only good thing about the four-story, Victorian-era home was that it faced south. The ridge in front of the window was great for drying tomatoes. The last unheated room was an excellent place to make and store homemade root beer. At about 5 or 6 years old, I walked to a local grade school, about five blocks away, myself. I associated with all students at school and on the playground. I never had them over to my house. I never recited in class because the teacher would always call on students beginning with the letter \u201ca\u201d or starting with the letter \u201cZ\u201d. Since \u201cJ\u201d and \u201cm\u201d were in the middle of the alphabet I was never called.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 186794, "end_char_idx": 188928, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3bcd200b-480f-44e8-be62-2b6e5f601b9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3bcd200b-480f-44e8-be62-2b6e5f601b9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jamesonsansone/Documents/captain-jim/source_documents/Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_name": "Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 224304, "creation_date": "2025-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-12-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93338b7d-5da6-4cb3-9ccd-cb6cbfa949d5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jamesonsansone/Documents/captain-jim/source_documents/Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_name": "Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 224304, "creation_date": "2025-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-12-29"}, "hash": "9c1c236b1a00cd5573dfcd24948325ca1e686f36a3f8a6cc8b685a4d00e3d053", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4c7a86d-755d-4118-9598-5cceb866a1ef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jamesonsansone/Documents/captain-jim/source_documents/Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_name": "Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 224304, "creation_date": "2025-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-12-29"}, "hash": "dc1d78c990d0ff05a68ced9546248222c4a4434825088aa93b85ac7c88355e81", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f36a00ce-c84e-4368-8968-5c6cd3d5d801", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a549709969d69da09c593d5f45bb82489d3a20c8f2ff1e28b9e944e7b716d452", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Since \u201cJ\u201d and \u201cm\u201d were in the middle of the alphabet I was never called. I used to sell papers for the Bridgeport post and the times star and shine shoes with my homemade shine box and stand. At times, when I had my shoe shine stand, I would count the number of freight cars on the train going by. I never got to count them all, because a shine customer would need my attention sooner than the caboose. A tavern located nearby would keep me busy and fed me with free pretzels. I applied this technique with the Salvation Army, receiving free donuts and coffee. At the end of grade school, everyone had to decide their curriculum in high school. It was either business, college preparatory, or commercial courses. I chose the college curriculum in Warren Harding high school in Bridgeport without consulting with my parents first. Very few students had intentions of going to college. I had to take science, chemistry, languages (Latin and German) and advanced mathematics courses, which all affected my life for many years to come. Many friends that I associated with chose the business or commercial courses. I enrolled at the University of Connecticut, which was known at that time as Connecticut agricultural College, the previous year by visiting to sign up and take an iQ test in a single visit. I was accepted to start in september 1940 in the freshman class. I was housed in the old shakes House located off campus on a hill near a huge water tower. I had to walk back and forth at least twice daily. At times I would meet a friend, sherman Chase, who liked to play ping-pong at the community house, located about halfway. We were both great ping-pong players and had the whole place to ourselves without interruption. The following two years\u2019 extra-curricular activity was learning to play soccer.

At that time, formally trained chemists in the manufacturing environment were not so common among the engineering community. The tank commander oversaw the functioning of over 160 individual tanks within the two Sikorsky plants in stratford and Bridgeport of varying sizes. Some tanks were as long as 40 feet to accommodate 36 foot long helicopter blades. The tank solutions varied with acids, alkalis, rinses, and metal plating in addition to temperature controls and exhausts. Therefore, the proper tank design and fabrication were important for successful and trouble-free operation. I was able to save millions of gallons of potable water each year by simply outfitting many reaction tanks with mist rinse nozzles so as to not pollute the rinse tank water. The greatest challenge that earned me the title \u201cwalking on water\u201d by my fellow chemist, Mr. Hugh Morris, happened in 19XX when the Pratt & Whitney jet engine company could not deliver finished engines to outfit Boeing aircraft in Seattle, Washington. Dozens of ready to fly model 7XX series aircraft were parked on the Boeing flight field with heavy concrete weights to prevent flipping. Awaiting a final solution to outfit the finished engines - they were grounded indefinitely. The Boeing Company was fining Pratt & Whitney millions of dollars each day for these delays. So, the old saying in business \u201ctime is money\u201d fit this situation nicely. The problem was that if we followed normal procedure and lead times, we were looking at several months to design, procure, and take delivery of the special tanks required for the process. The engine parts were large seven foot diameter stainless steel rings with noise suppression material bonded internally. In order to properly bond, it was necessary to etch the ring using hot sulfuric acid followed by a water rinse and immersion into nitrichydrofluoric acid followed by a rinse. After drying, the parts were ready for the bonding process. The 7 foot diameter test piece was sent to the Bridgeport plant for processing in a 9 foot deep tank but the pratt & Whitney engineers wanted the part that was one foot high to be immersed flat.

Some of the tank lining material sheets required must be made of polypropylene and polyvinyl, which was difficult to procure in the state of Connecticut. These polymers have only recently been made available in large sheet forms. I must add that I had in-depth knowledge and fascination of polymer chemistry. The proper choice of material for processing tanks helped to keep the tanks operational for a longer period time. I used to advise the maintenance department on the proper choice of materials for fabrication equipment. Fortunately, I had in the Sikorsky plant enough 4 foot by 8 foot polypropylene and same size polyvinyl sheets to make two acid reaction tanks at 8 foot by 8 foot by 2 foot. I ordered a stainless heating coil for one tank which was readily available. Our tool room personnel did a fantastic job to weld the sheets and support the bottom and sides with steel cables and 2 inch by 4 inch wood - delivering them to the Bridgeport plants in two days. The tanks were positioned in a basin area with an overhead crane next to a plastic swimming pool I had procured; to use as a spray rinse tank. It was highly unorthodox to bring in a kids swimming pool but it worked! I mixed the hot etching sulfuric acid solution and the desmut hydrofluoricnitric acid solution and the 7seven-foot diameter jet engine rings were processed per specification for bonding and test at Pratt & Whitney aircraft company in Hartford, Connecticut.

Mission accomplished in three days!\n\nCHAPTER 16 FROM THREE DAY LAYOFF TO BOOSTER PRODUCTION\nAs it is known throughout the industry, the helicopter business had its ups and downs. In 1961, helicopter production dropped at sikorsky aircraft and consequently a reduction in workforce occurred. Since some departments were affected more than others, my job was eliminated from the design engineering department. For three days I sought employment elsewhere inside and outside the company. I was contacted by mr. John Harvey, the group leader in the manufacturing engineer department at sikorsky. He requested me to join his group to help build the titan IIiC booster portion of the saturn rocket. John was a wonderful man, colleague, and friend of mine for many years. Martin marietta was the prime contractor on this major project for the government. Sikorsky needed this subcontract in order to keep the reduced workforce employed. This project, of course, was not something we had experience with but the basic elements of material processing still applied; just more creatively then what we were used to. Since our design engineering department in those days was not typically directly involved in the manufacturing process, I was tasked with conceiving the booster material finishing requirements with our manufacturing equipment capability in mind and executing to a finished product. Design for manufacture was not yet a known concept in engineering. The booster required a critical element, the heat shield, to allow it to operate at the extreme high temperatures. The heat shield needed to function properly and flawlessly to protect expensive equipment on the booster. Without it, the rocket would not function as intended. Eventually, all the elements in the project meshed to produce the titan IIiC booster at the sikorsky production facilities in stratford and Bridgeport, Connecticut.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 201233, "end_char_idx": 203457, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca9d8d93-20ad-41b0-8353-a3ede203195d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca9d8d93-20ad-41b0-8353-a3ede203195d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jamesonsansone/Documents/captain-jim/source_documents/Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_name": "Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 224304, "creation_date": "2025-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-12-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93338b7d-5da6-4cb3-9ccd-cb6cbfa949d5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jamesonsansone/Documents/captain-jim/source_documents/Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_name": "Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 224304, "creation_date": "2025-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-12-29"}, "hash": "9c1c236b1a00cd5573dfcd24948325ca1e686f36a3f8a6cc8b685a4d00e3d053", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3764661f-1c85-46c6-b969-5a8433773203", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jamesonsansone/Documents/captain-jim/source_documents/Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_name": "Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 224304, "creation_date": "2025-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-12-29"}, "hash": "14504fdd48cf8ba6a52ff30ada63970cdc12dd2ae2bf3f45c4d52a0115d32d11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "272e4c97-6547-4415-8c35-70ae457b2179", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9bb16c7fdb05880c2044bfb62c63d970cc65f2f25e850ba3550ba62a5fabfbe2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Without it, the rocket would not function as intended. Eventually, all the elements in the project meshed to produce the titan IIiC booster at the sikorsky production facilities in stratford and Bridgeport, Connecticut. However, there was one very difficult requirement to comply with; the application of a special silicone material of varying thickness between 20 and 200 thousandths of an inch. This was an application nightmare and to my knowledge was never done prior in the industry. The areas that required different thicknesses were close to each other and the only known means at the time of applying this ablative mix was by spraying using paint equipment due to the irregular surface contour. The thick build-up would be impossible to achieve and the overspray would be a big waste of material which cost in excess of $120/ gallon. This special silicone material was manufactured by the Dow Corning company near Fort Knox, Kentucky. Not only did it have heat resistant silicones in it but also had micro-ceramic ball fillers. Their chemist showed me the spray equipment to apply the material but I knew it would not work for our application. Since Martin Marietta designers specified thicknesses on a 4-foot by 6-foot convoluted ribbed and curved aluminum sheet, this would be extremely difficult for a hand-held paint sprayer to meet the finish thickness requirements. The martin marietta and Dow engineers helped as best they could but could not devise the equipment to meet requirements. I was alone to figure out how to meet this requirement. Instead of battling with the spray process, I decided to change the process. I devised a special tool to apply the silicone ablative compound to the specified thickness with good adhesion on the fabricated heat shield. The tool consisted of a reinforced fiberglass epoxy mold which took its shape from a sample part layered with built-up wax sheeting which represented the drawing specification. The new mold tool was clamped to the heat shield and the catalyst mixed silicone material was pumped into the varying gap between the heat shield to be coated and the special tooling. When the ablative coating cured, the mold was removed and the finished shield was ready for use or shipment. There were many other problems which had to be solved in order to finish the metal parts of the heat shield.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 203238, "end_char_idx": 205592, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "272e4c97-6547-4415-8c35-70ae457b2179": {"__data__": {"id_": "272e4c97-6547-4415-8c35-70ae457b2179", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jamesonsansone/Documents/captain-jim/source_documents/Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_name": "Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 224304, "creation_date": "2025-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-12-29"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93338b7d-5da6-4cb3-9ccd-cb6cbfa949d5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jamesonsansone/Documents/captain-jim/source_documents/Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_name": "Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 224304, "creation_date": "2025-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-12-29"}, "hash": "9c1c236b1a00cd5573dfcd24948325ca1e686f36a3f8a6cc8b685a4d00e3d053", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca9d8d93-20ad-41b0-8353-a3ede203195d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/jamesonsansone/Documents/captain-jim/source_documents/Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_name": "Three_Day_Pass.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 224304, "creation_date": "2025-12-19", "last_modified_date": "2025-12-29"}, "hash": "534540d9286defda2750c0eb42d7670570c6a59998335d563e70fd6de3751cd4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "716b001e-c81e-45d4-8121-84818d5b9f6b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6aff3d58094fc6d90034693e4b41c555c9bf70e9f15ba32feb1c8acf9fc22ea7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "When the ablative coating cured, the mold was removed and the finished shield was ready for use or shipment. There were many other problems which had to be solved in order to finish the metal parts of the heat shield. Most of these parts were made of aluminum which where heat treated for strength and it required special chemical bath treatments to promote paint primer adhesion. The chemical baths were modified so that the primer and top coat would pass the wet tape tests. The wet tape adhesion test consisted of the following: after the paint had dried for 24 hours, a water soaked cloth under a watch glass was placed on a painted surface for a period of 24 hours. A special tape placed on the test area would be used to try and remove the paint. If no paint loss was found, the test was deemed successful. The titan IIiC Booster would power the world\u2019s first successful aerospace craft to reach the moon! Another huge problem that occurred was the phosphate treatment of a 10 foot diameter ring which was very heavy and difficult to manipulate in a treatment tank. Sikorsky aircraft manufacturing facilities did not have the space or the tanks to treat such a large object. This was another impossible task to meet the drawing specification. However, I developed a spray procedure to accomplish the same results as the dip process. Management was grateful that sikorsky aircraft was able to do the whole job using existing equipment within the plant. I am very proud that I was able to do all the necessary work that successfully took men to the moon. Furthermore, most of these booster parts fell back to earth into the ocean and recovered to be used over and over again. This attests to the durability of the parts. My resourcefulness and personal attention and commitment allowed this project to be successful. Knowing what was available, the options, and the risks, created a positive outcome; not much different than what I experienced twenty years before.

Jim has just graduated from rensselaer tech with a masters degree in engineering and I thought it was a good idea for him and me to take a european summer vacation. We decided to spend 21 days to visit seven countries. Our Lufthansa plane landed in Frankfurt germany on the same day that Kuwait was invaded by sadam Hussein\u2019s iraqi forces. The airport was surrounded with armed guards but we still decided to rent an automobile; a 1990 mercedes-Benz 190e. We had no reservations and no plans, but decided to visit the old siegfried line in the geilenkirken area of germany. I had a large video camera with me and for some unknown reason the camera would not take pictures. It made me think about the dead people. I later found out that I forgot to put the on button to start the motion picture mode. The seven countries visited were the netherlands, germany, switzerland, France, Italy, austria and the important focal country of Belgium. We drove over 3,000 miles. I made sure that we visited the Heidelberg and eberbach areas where we spent much time as occupation troops before returning home to the United states. We next went south to switzerland and spent about three days in their capital city and Basel. Next we drove through the tunnel under the swiss alps to turin Italy. One humorous incident was when we parked our car under a tree in front of the hotel and the next morning upon checking out, we found we had been \u201cgreeted\u201d by apparently several thousand birds requiring a visit to a car wash.

After an exciting drive through the French alps we came upon the beaches of Cannes in the French riviera. This was truly a spectacular place where the extreme wealth was apparent everywhere. The next day we drove through the French countryside on our way to genoa, Italy. Since this was august, most of the accommodations in the beach areas were already taken by visitors from Germany. We drove inland to find lodging for the night in the town of Carcare. We liked this place very much because of the genial inhabitants, fine food, and the fact that local people played bocci ball. These local players really knew how to play the game. I know because when I was young I used to play bocci ball with my dad during the summer months when the weather was very hot but I did not mind because we were playing under a grape arbor with my dad grew over the bocci court below. The next day we were headed for the town of pisa, Italy. We spent several days there enjoying the food and the sites and also taking pictures of the tower of pisa. Next we went to the city of rome and spent three days in the luxury apartments in the suburbs and came back to visit the Coliseum. Needing some guidance, we inquired at a local police station for directions. One of the officers coming off her shift offered to have us follow her. Did you ever follow an italian through the streets of rome? Later on we went to naples and stayed in several pensions and hotels. At one hotel, several strangers approached us and were insistent to help with our luggage. To avoid a mounting tense situation, we decided that this was not a safe area so we moved to another hotel near the railroad station. The next day we went to the town of pompeII and inspected the excavated areas. We did spend one day on the black sands of the beaches.

During the day we took the city bus to Venice walking the narrow streets and visiting the canals. The restaurant in the hotel where we ate our meals was also the place where we spent our evening. The location was directly across the street from a park where the festival was held. The locals were friendly and interested in hearing about where we lived in the U.s. The next day we headed north and went to stuttgart, austria through the dolomite mountains. The mountain range was absolutely beautiful and so was the town of stuttgart where we purchased a cuckoo clock characteristic of the area. After 21 days we were ready to return to Frankfort and home. I do have some regrets about this entire vacation journey through Europe. The biggest regret that we\u2019ll always haunt me is that I never met any of the townspeople of Beho (gouvy), Belgium. It seems I was always in a rush to make up time when I got to this town. I have never physically stepped into the town like the other 84th division soldiers. Maybe, I will make time the next time that I am in the vicinity. I know that Jeff Neysen has returned to his town of birth and living there at this moment. I knew Jeff neysen when he lived in milano, Italy. I also regret that I did not meet my father\u2019s relations when I was in the town of anagni about 30 miles outside of rome in the surrounding mountains. My dad, Umberto, had passed away several years before and I could not ask him who to visit or where the family resided.

Of course, I started to conjured up some of the things that I did back in January, 1945. As a reward , myself and Dr. Robert reid, a former 84th division veteran, were invited to celebrate the book signing of mr.

I was to fly from LaGuardia airport New York to Dulles in Washington DC to join the Greatest Generation Foundations staff and nineteen of my fellow veterans, for a non-stop flight to Brussels, Belgium. Due to bad weather my flight was forced to land in Baltimore. I then contacted Mr. Davis who instructed me to go to Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare airport and take the next flight to Brussels,Belgium which he arranged.. After rescheduling and boarding the Baltimore flight to Chicago the jet had landing gear problems and subsequent deicing procedures due to snowy and icing conditions. All these precautions delayed the takeoff by one hour. Guess what? The Transatlantic Jet to Brussels waited on the tarmac loaded with passengers in Chicago waiting for \u201clittle old me\u201d. I finally arrived at O\u2019Hare airport fully dressed in my 70 year old authentic Captain\u2019s uniform was like a movie thriller. Everyone on my flight was ordered to remain in their seats to allow me to disembark the aircraft first to get to my connection as quickly as possible. Everyone on this flight gave me a hero\u2019s send off as I whisked by them in their seats. Next, I was motorized on a cart with two attendants speeding through the airport to the\u201dpatiently\u201d waiting jet. Fully expecting to be greeted by angry passenger for holding up the flight for an hour much to my surprise I was greeted by cheering as I rapidly moved to my seat in first class. I felt like saluting them and I did just that with gratitude. It was indeed an Honor FLigHt. I later found out that the flight had pulled away from the gate and was ordered back to the gate to wait for me , it was my only hope of getting to Brussels in time for the ceremony at the AmeriCan EmassY. When I landed in Brussels, I was an hour late to attend the beautiful reception for our group at the American Consulate.

Now I must write it because it is part of the whole equation. Einstein had it right, \u201cthat everything is related\u201d. You will agree when you start changing the \u201ci\u2019s\u201d for eyes. Look around yourself and think about what you have read in this book about your 3-day pass to restoring your self and the armed forces attention to preserve the morale and strength of it\u2019s members. Everything in this Universal needs time to heal. Does healing make everything healthier or normal? It should if the equation is balanced. It seems that there is an unbalance on this earth because one of the components in the equation is not recycling properly.

We must put carbon dioxide excess to work or produce less carbon dioxide to restore the natural balanced equation. Nature has recycled this planet with a balanced equation for millions of years. It is obvious that in a mere 2000 years, especially the last 200 years of human activity, that the present carbon recycle is not natural. It is now absolutely clear in my mind that everyone on this planet must think or mediate a solution to this huge problem which is life-threatening. The theme of this book, assessing and assisting, (DiY) can solve the problem especially when it is performed on your three day pass or your civilian weekend. Thinking or mediating to restore yourself each weekend can also be combined to the activities to restore the planet. \u201cgetting back to nature\u201d will produce immediate solutions without huge payback costs for flamboyant life styles. Be an energized miser! It is very difficult to imagine that an individual can make a big difference in the outcome of this battle. The reason why I say this is simply because pollution of the planet was caused solely by the human life on this planet earth. The unbalance restarted when humans decided to multiply their power with the use of machines such as automobiles. The automobiles consume gasoline to power their engines. Enormous power was created when the gasoline combined with the oxygen taken from the atmosphere to produce carbon dioxide. Naturally, the trees on the planet earth recycles the carbon dioxide to restoring oxygen. As long as the volume of carbon dioxide remained low trees were able to restore the atmosphere. The use of the combustion engine became so popular that everyone started to use it. Everyone longs for the day when they can own their own automobile and improve their lifestyle. Use of power did not stop here, everyone started to use electricity powered appliances and light up their homes. The power industry was created to burn coal and create electricity. It was a no-brainer or an entrepreneur to use cheap natural resources to create unlimited energy for electricity. The trees could not extract all the carbon dioxide that was created. The excess carbon dioxide was undoubtedly absorbed by the oceans.
